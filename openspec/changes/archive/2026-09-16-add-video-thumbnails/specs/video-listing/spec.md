## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: List Videos For A Playlist
The system SHALL provide an HTTP endpoint that, given a tracked playlist's ID, returns every video recorded for that playlist, including each video's ID, title, status, quality (when downloaded), filename (when downloaded), and thumbnail filename (when present). For a YouTube-linked playlist, the returned videos SHALL be ordered by their current position in the source YouTube playlist. For a custom playlist, no particular order is guaranteed.

#### Scenario: Playlist has videos
- **WHEN** a client requests the videos of a tracked playlist that has one or more recorded videos
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 200 and a list containing each of those videos

#### Scenario: Playlist has no videos
- **WHEN** a client requests the videos of a tracked playlist that has no recorded videos
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 200 and an empty list

#### Scenario: Playlist does not exist
- **WHEN** a client requests the videos of a playlist ID that is not currently tracked
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 400 and does not return a list

#### Scenario: YouTube-linked playlist's videos are ordered by playlist position
- **WHEN** a client requests the videos of a YouTube-linked playlist
- **THEN** the daemon returns them ordered by their position in the source YouTube playlist, matching the order they appear in on YouTube

### Requirement: List Videos For A Channel
The system SHALL provide an HTTP endpoint that, given a tracked channel's handle, returns every video recorded for that channel, including each video's ID, title, status, quality (when downloaded), filename (when downloaded), and thumbnail filename (when present), ordered by recency (most recently uploaded first).

#### Scenario: Channel has videos
- **WHEN** a client requests the videos of a tracked channel that has one or more recorded videos
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 200 and a list containing each of those videos, ordered most recent first

#### Scenario: Channel has no videos
- **WHEN** a client requests the videos of a tracked channel that has no recorded videos
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 200 and an empty list

#### Scenario: Channel does not exist
- **WHEN** a client requests the videos of a channel handle that is not currently tracked
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 400 and does not return a list
